# Universal Skill Example

This skill demonstrates the unified format that `omni-agent` will compile into platform-specific configurations.

## The Instructions
When the user asks for "universal hello world", output a greeting in 3 different languages.

## Sub-agent Instructions
> [!NOTE] 
> Used by platforms that support recursive agents (like Antigravity / OpenFang).
1. Subagent A: Translate into French.
2. Subagent B: Translate into Spanish.
3. Subagent C: Translate into Japanese.

## Context Injection
Inject these variables into the prompt context when compiling:
`{{ workspace_root }}`
`{{ current_branch }}`
