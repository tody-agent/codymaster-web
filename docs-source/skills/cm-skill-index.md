description: "Progressive Disclosure skill index — efficient skill loading in 3 layers. Layer 1 (index, ~100 tokens) always loaded. Layer 2 (summary, ~300 tokens) loaded on context need. Layer 3 (full SKILL.md) loaded on execution only."
---

# Skill Index — Progressive Disclosure Engine

> **Save 90%+ tokens.** Agents scan the index first, load full skills only when executing.
> Inspired by Loki Mode's 3-Layer Progressive Disclosure memory architecture.

## The Problem

Traditional approach: Load every SKILL.md to decide which skill to use.
- 30+ skills × ~3000 tokens each = **90,000+ tokens just for discovery**
- Agent only needs ~500 tokens to make the choice
- **89,500 tokens wasted on reading full skills**

## The Solution: 3-Layer Loading

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LAYER 1: INDEX (~100 tokens per skill)          │
│ Always loaded. Quick scan. "What exists?"        │
│ Name + Domain + Triggers + 1-line summary       │
└─────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                      │ (match found?)
                      v
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LAYER 2: SUMMARY (~300 tokens per skill)        │
│ Load when choosing. "Is this the right one?"     │
│ Description + When to use + Integration table   │
└─────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                      │ (confirmed?)
                      v
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LAYER 3: FULL SKILL.md (1500-5000 tokens)       │
│ Load ONLY during execution. "How to use it."     │
│ Complete instructions, examples, red flags       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Layer 1: Skill Index

**Always loaded by agents at session start.** Maximum 100 tokens per skill.

**Discovery Protocol:**
```
1. Check THIS index first (59 skills above)
   → Match found? → npx skills add {source} --skill {name} -a antigravity
2. No match? → npx skills find "{keyword}" on skills.sh
3. Still nothing? → Proceed without skill, note gap in .cm-skills-log.json

Trigger points:
  - cm-start Step 0.5 (before planning)
  - cm-planning Phase A Step 4 (scope analysis)
  - cm-execution Pre-flight (before dispatch)
  - cm-execution RARV (after 2 failed retries)
```

## Layer 2: Skill Summary

**Loaded when an agent has matched a skill from Layer 1 and needs more context.**

To access Layer 2, read the first 20 lines of the corresponding SKILL.md (frontmatter + first section).

```
Example: cm-tdd Layer 2
  - Full name: "TDD — Test Before Write"
  - When to Use: ALWAYS before implementing any feature or bugfix
  - Process: Red (write failing test) → Green (minimal code) → Refactor (clean up)
  - Integration: Works with cm-execution (subagent TDD), cm-quality-gate (coverage check)
  - Token cost: ~4200 tokens for full skill
```

## Layer 3: Full SKILL.md

**Loaded ONLY when executing.** Read the complete SKILL.md file.

```bash
# Agent loads full skill only when ready to execute
view_file /path/to/skills/cm-tdd/SKILL.md
```

## Usage Protocol

```
1. AT SESSION START:
   - Load this skill index (Layer 1) — costs ~2500 tokens total
   - Now you know what 60 skills do without reading any of them

2. WHEN MATCHING A TASK:
   - Scan Layer 1 triggers to find matching skill(s)
   - If unsure, read Layer 2 (first 20 lines of SKILL.md)
   - Choose the best skill

3. WHEN EXECUTING:
   - Load Layer 3 (full SKILL.md) for the chosen skill
   - Follow the skill's instructions completely

4. SAVINGS:
    - Without index: 34 × 3000 = 102,000 tokens
    - With index: 2800 + 300 + 3000 = 6,100 tokens
    - Saved: ~95,900 tokens (~94%)
```

## Skill Domain Mapping

For dynamic agent selection (Phase 3), skills map to domains:

```yaml
engineering: [cm-tdd, cm-debugging, cm-quality-gate, cm-test-gate, cm-code-review, cm-codeintell, cm-reactor, cm-clean-code]
operations: [cm-safe-deploy, cm-identity-guard, cm-git-worktrees, cm-terminal, cm-safe-i18n]
security: [cm-secret-shield]
product: [cm-brainstorm-idea, cm-planning, cm-ux-master, cm-ui-preview, cm-dockit, cm-project-bootstrap, cm-jtbd]
growth: [cm-content-factory, cm-ads-tracker, cm-cro-methodology]
orchestration: [cm-execution, cm-continuity, cm-skill-mastery, cm-skill-chain, cm-deep-search, cm-readit, cm-how-it-work]
commands: [cm-start, cm-dashboard, cm-status]
# planned (no SKILL.md yet): mom-test, release-it, medical-research, tailwind-mastery, pandasai-analytics, cm-google-form
```

## The Bottom Line

**Know everything. Load nothing. Execute precisely. Save 90%+ tokens.**
