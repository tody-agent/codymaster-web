## [5.0.0] - 2026-04-02 (CodyMaster Founders Edition)

### 🚀 A New Era: The "Neural Spine" Upgrade

CodyMaster officially moves beyond the "Content Factory" era to transform into a true **AI-Native Engineering Workspace**. Thoroughly curing the "AI rote learning, memory loss, and code hallucination" disease with a new core architecture integrated from the power of **OpenSpace** and **OpenViking**!

---

### ⚙️ New Architecture & Execution Flow

**1. OpenViking Integration (Vector Brain & AST Semantics):**
The outdated RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system has been completely replaced:
- **L0/L1/L2 Structure:** OpenViking reads and maps the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) of the entire project system. When the AI needs context for a module, it only scans the relevant "surface" (Interface Signature - L1) instead of blindly copy-pasting thousands of lines of detailed code (L2).
- **Result:** Coherent memory across the entire project. Completely eliminates "hallucination" errors, forgotten imports, or incorrect parameters when making cross-file calls. Reduces token costs by more than 10x.

**2. OpenSpace Integration (Isolation Sandbox & Self-Healing Capabilities):**
You no longer need to manually copy/paste errors back to the environment for the AI to know what's broken!
- **Autonomous Terminal:** Agents are automatically granted sandbox environment permissions to run tests (`npm run test:gate`, `ts-node`, `git log`) in isolation.
- **Self-Healing Loop:** If AI-generated code encounters syntax errors or unit test failures, *OpenSpace* captures the entire error stream (Stderr) and feeds it directly back to the AI. The AI then self-diagnoses and rewrites the fix before presenting the final result to you.

> **Experience Note:** With this Neural Spine design, instead of acting as a mere text generation tool (Typer), CodyMaster v5 operates like a true Senior Engineer—from understanding context and self-building to self-testing until it's ready to ship to the Deploy environment.
